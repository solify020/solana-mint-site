To setup a Candy Machine:

- Create your Candy Machine using [Sugar](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/how-to-guides/my-first-candy-machine-part1) (now supports pNFTs)
- Change token standard to pNFT: `sugar config set -t pnft`
- Make sure you have setup your [Candy Guard](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/how-to-guides/my-first-candy-machine-part1#candy-guards---further-configuration). *This is a necessary step.*

After these, you can use this UI to mint pNFTs.
